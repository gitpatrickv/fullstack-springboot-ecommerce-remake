## Project Status
This project is a work in progress!
More features are being added.

## Project Overview
This personal project is focused on creating an online shopping platform similar to Shopee.
The goal is to enhance my skills in both backend and frontend development, explore different techniques
and refactor [My First Full-Stack Project](https://github.com/gitpatrickv/Fullstack-Ecommerce-Backend-Springboot), which has messy and unstructured code.
Additionally, this project serves as a reference for when I use different backend or frontend frameworks, 
helping me easily recall key concepts and techniques.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React v18, TypeScript, Chakra UI, React Query, Zustand
- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Java 21, MySql
- **Authentication:** Spring Security, JWT
- **DevOps:** Docker, Github Actions
